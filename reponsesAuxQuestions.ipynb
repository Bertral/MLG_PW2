    "### Q1. Determine where do we define all the above mentioned parameters. Observe that we run the evaluation procedure on four different problems. Each problem is a two-class two-dimensional problem, where the two sets are more and more overlapped (e.g., the synthetic datasets are randomly generated using variances of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7).\n",
    "###  Q2. What are the cyan and red curves in those plots ? Why are they different ?\n",
    "###  Q3. What happens with the training and test errors (MSE) when we have the two sets more overlapped ?\n",
    "###  Q4. Why sometimes the red curves indicate a higher error than the cyan ones ?\n",
    "###  Q5. What is showing the boxplot summarizing the validation errors of the preceding experiments ?\n",
    "# 2. Explore the “cross_validation” notebook\n",
    "### Q1. Determine where do we define all the above mentioned parameters.\n",
    "### Q2. What is the difference between hold-out and cross-validation ? What is the new parameter that has to be defined for cross-validation ?\n",
    "### Q3. Observe the boxplots summarizing the validation errors obtained using the cross-validation method and compare them with those obtained by hold-out validation.\n",

For each of the following experiments, provide a brief description of the number of observations of each class, the features being used to train the model, the procedure (explain) for selecting the final model (e.g., use the model_building.ipynb notebook), the description of the final model and its evaluation (i.e., provide the cross-validation results, the confusion matrix and the F-score). Comment your results.\n",
